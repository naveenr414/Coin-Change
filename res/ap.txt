AP [Start] - All Polynomials
In a file "Dump.txt", write the regression values. 
Each regression value starts at 1 till n.
It repeats [Number of Coins - 1]*[LCM of Coins] times,
printing the currnet iteration mod LCM of Coins. 
Every N polynomials should be the same (where need to find N). 
For Example, for American, it is every 5th coin is the same.
